Introduction
------------

The time-order project was created by Noah Healy as a way to securely
create a verifiable, unique iterator for any content. The end user
submits 3 items: 

- a checksum of their content

- desired type of iterator

- your public key


We add a unique iterator, and sign the package with our public key. 

The process happens on a very secure central server. The iterator is
both a unique order and a unique identifier.

Create a time-order iterator

Verify a time order iterator, especially to confirm that some second
iterator is before/after your iterator.
